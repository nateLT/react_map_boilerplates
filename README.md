# React map boiler plate

In todays world of front end development if your not using a major frame work angular, vue.js, react your kind of out of date I need to get
my skills back up on framework. Most of my tech life I have been in a position that I am always jumping from technology or products, when
you finaly get somewhat good at something you jump to a different project and language or meets some other criteria. 
I am choosing react becouse react native, mapbox, and I love mapbox products, and I like the feel of when i used it in the past when I was using it in the past.

This repo is dedicated to expanding my knowledge incorporating arcgisjs 4.14 and even seeing if its possible to incorporate datatables.net is
basic js library that i just started playing with that i have mixed feelings about it dose some cool things with a table but the set up and functionality
of passing data to me I very much dislike when editing rows, trying to connect to a already built rest api, and other quirks.

## react arcgis 4.14 

 My goal is to use typescript with react but its possible to run into problems
 if you want to use a random library you have to uptodate type declaration files for it this can be a pain to build or keep up.

## react datatables.net
